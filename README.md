# OCR Web App Testing

This is a test of the Tessaract.js library.

To run locally:

```
npm start
```

To build:

```
npm run build
```

## The code

The interesting bits are probably in [src/components/App.tsx](src/components/App.tsx). This project was based on my [template-js](https://github.com/gregtatum/template-js) project.
