# JS Template

This is my template for a modren JavaScript environment, dear me.

It uses:
 * Parcel for bundling and the web server.
 * TypeScript for type checking.
 * Eslint for linting.
 * Prettier for code reformatting, powered by Eslint.
 * VSCode settings for auto-fixing errors.
 * React/Redux for front-end UI.
 * Jest for testing, which uses Babel for transpilation.
 * React testing library for UI tests.

## Usage

If this is not a React project then run:

```
./bin/remove-react.sh
```
